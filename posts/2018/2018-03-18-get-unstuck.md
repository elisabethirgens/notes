I’ve been feeling stuck the past weeks. The exercises in [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/) are getting harder. And making [“Three in a Row“]({{ '/2018/02/game/' | url }}) has seemed out of reach. I _know_ I just need to invest time with it all — but I’ve struggled to find motivation to do that enough.

It’s been 9 months since I [started the experiment]({{ '/2017/06/hello-world/' | url }}) of writing these notes. And much like I had a theory about 45 (!!) blog posts ago, there is something that motivates me about _publishing_ them. I&nbsp;don’t generally show them to anyone, but the act of putting words out in the world means:

- I have to make sure that what I’m writing is correct. 📖
- A post is finished the moment it’s published. ✅
- I get to feel a sense of accomplishment about that. 🏆

An unexpected bonus of having these notes, is revisiting what I was frustrated about before. This is an excellent reality check for when I feel like I’m not learning. I&nbsp;can go back and read what I wrote a couple of months ago, and get genuinely surprised. _“Wat why where you confused about this thing which is OBVIOUS.”_ This happens over and over.

So here’s to hopefully be doing exactly that in a couple of weeks about classes and objects and building a game in Python. 🙈🐍💻
