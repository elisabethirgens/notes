title: "“I haven’t learnt JS yet” is my broken record"

I don’t _have_ to learn JS. I could _start_ to learn, then change my mind. Both would be fine. But there’s no point telling myself for years that “I _want_ to learn JavaScript — but haven’t yet”.

## First attempt

**July 2014:** Email archives reveal that I bought the [javascriptbook.com](http://javascriptbook.com) 3 years ago. 😱 Why didn’t I read it? Because I was preoccupied with running a business. I did put substantial effort into expanding my skillset at the time. But I needed to [focus on skills I could sell]({{ '/2017/06/learning/' | url }}), and didn’t think interesting clients with fun projects would chase down the doors of a newbie javascripter.

## Second attempt

**January 2016:** I started using work hours on Thursdays until lunch for study time, and was making steady progess on this book for a while. The notebook I used resurfaced, and I was surprised now to discover the amount of decent studying I’d done. Two things came in the way last year:

- It became trickier to reserve blocks of time for studying during my week.
- And then I got really busy [organizing a conference](http://cssconfno.github.io/2016/) in my spare time.

## Third attempt

**July 2017:** I have time and energy now. If I don’t make any progress this summer, it’s a sign I don’t actually want this enough and can let it go. (But today is not that day!) Here’s the plan:

- Figure out some reasons [Why I want to learn JavaScript]({{ '/2017/06/javascript/' | url }}). ✅

- Invest a little bit of time (but not too much!) on revising previously mentioned book & notes. The book is old, but still does a very nice job of explaining basic concepts like functions, methods and objects in a visual way to people who don’t have a CS background. 👌

- Make [short assignments]({{ '/2017/06/bird-by-bird/' | url }})!! Tiny tasks for myself on CodePen. 👾

- Get to know the [MDN web docs on JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and dive into the practical course. 🚀

- Seek out more tasks involving JavaScript at work. 💻
