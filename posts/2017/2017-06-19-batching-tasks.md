What ifâ€¦ I get as good at batching work tasks as I am at batching errands? ðŸ¤” Yesterday I completed an errand raid so carefree and efficient, that it led to a minor eureka moment. If I can run this many errands with so little hassle â€” how much can I improve batching tasks at work? Because when it comes to shopping and errands, Iâ€™m quite pro at:

- not excessively stocking up on shampoo or deodorant, but never running out either
- spending as little time as possible, and also; **as few afternoons as possible** (keeping huge blocks of time free for more interesting activities)
- making the errands efficient by planning upfront
- not spending too much time thinking about what to get (this is probably why I mostly prefer physical shops when possible, because Iâ€™ll easily spend forever shopping online)
- differentiating between next and someday errands
- always considering that **maybe I donâ€™t even need this thingâ€¦?**
- or if itâ€™s possible to wait to buy this thingâ€¦?

The idea is not new to me, I do it already with some tasksâ€¦ like email. And expense reports! Though that might be procrastination rather than intentional batching. But I will try to learn more from what motivates me to get my shit together around these practicalities.

**Note to self** â€” Identify more tasks to batch. Practice being critical of what even needs to happen.
