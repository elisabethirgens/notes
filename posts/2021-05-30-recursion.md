title: "Battle with Recursion"

Writing my first recursive function in C was not too bad. But writing a recursive function that _actually_ did what I intended the program to do? A different story. ðŸ™ˆ I am writing this post to remind future me, of just how much I struggled with this â€” but kept at it anyway.

## CS50 ðŸŽ“

I am doing [CS50 with a distributed study group]({{ '/2020/11/start-cs50/' | url }}) and in week 3 (Algorithms) the course introduces [recursion](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/shorts/recursion/) with the factorial function as an example. Seemed fine! Until I tried to write my own.

Recursion is not a requirement in any of the problem sets with C. But when I submitted my solution for [Filter](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/4/filter/less) in week 4 (Memory), I had the gnawing feeling that I really should try to grok writing recursive functions. My program passed all the tests to full score, but the nested loops and if&nbsp;statements felt
ridiculously out of hand.

## Going back to Mario ðŸ§±

The [first CS50 problem in C](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/1/mario/more/) is a program to print a pyramid from Super Mario.

```

```

Surely after some weeks of coding in C, well into pointers and memory allocation, I should easily manage to refactor my Mario program to use a recursive function? Ha! Hahahaha. Lol. Nope. Not easily at all.

## Running locally ðŸ’»

The [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) is fantastic for getting started, but now it was time to figure out how to run my programs locally. Figured out how to install [cs50/libcs50](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50). Then compile with for example

```
gcc -lcs50 -o recursion recursion.c
```

to be able to run program `./recursion`. Neat!

## Think recursively? ðŸ§ 

My study buddy [Agata Maria](https://twitter.com/ja_gatka/) recommended these two posts:

- [Learning to think with recursion](https://medium.com/@daniel.oliver.king/getting-started-with-recursion-f89f57c5b60e)
- [How to Think Recursively | Solving Recursion Problems in 4 Steps](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-think-recursively-solving-recursion-problems-in-4-steps-95a6d07aa866)

And sure enough, they helped me to write my first recursive function.

```

It was upside down. And only half the pyramid, but how hard could it be to complete?

_Several days later and multiple hours of serious [focused hours]({{ '/2021/03/deep-work/' | url }}) have passed._

I gave up. It was a sunny Sunday in April I should have been spending outdoors, and I decided to move on with my life. I tried searching for a solution (not cheating, because I submitted the problem months ago and writing a recursive version was not an official problem) but found no solutions, comments from people who gave up, but also this one person who proclaimed:

> Recursion in Mario: finally got it to work after a month!

> I've been trying to figure out how to create a recursive function that draws a right-aligned pyramid ever since recursion was introduced in the lectures. (â€¦) I feel so relieved and accomplished. Now it's 2AMâ€¦

They never post any code, but reading this sheer joy of succeeding inspired me to keep at it for another 45 minutes. Lo and behold, don't you think I finally got the damn thing working. My recursive function to print a Mario pyramid locally. ðŸ¥³

```
gcc -lcs50 -o recursion recursion.c
./recursion
