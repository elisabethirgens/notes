title:  "Revisit Intro to Logic, Lists and Loops"

As part of my mission to [Get Unstuck]({{ '/2018/03/get-unstuck/' | url }}), I‚Äôve now realized that if I‚Äôm not sufficiently inspired to tackle moving forward ‚Äî backtracking can be great. Moving beats standing still! But I‚Äôve been too impatient to discover how useful it can be to revisit previous chapters in [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/). During exercises 27‚Äì39, the content felt pretty familiar. I‚Äôve seen lists and loops and `if`s before, none of it was brand new magic. But maaaybe I breezed through this part of the book too fast. Let‚Äôs revisit!

## The Truth Terms

>  Logic on a computer is all about seeing if some combination of these characters and some variables is True at that point in the program.

`and`&emsp;`or`&emsp;`not`&emsp;`!=`&emsp;`==`&emsp;`>=`&emsp;`<=`&emsp;`True`&emsp;`False`

* Exercise 27 is about memorizing truth tables.
* Exercise 28 is practicing more complex Boolean logic.
* _‚ÄúBurn Boolean logic into your brain‚Äù_ üòú

Note to self: those two ‚òùÔ∏è are worth revisiting when I need easy-going backtrack studying.

## Arithmetic Operators

These are the basic ones `+` `-` `*` `/`, along with more complex ones like Modulus&nbsp;`%` and Exponent&nbsp;`**` that I really don‚Äôt see myself needing any time soon, but this one is worth noting:

| `//` | Floor Division | `9//2 = 4` |

## Comparison Operators

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `==` | equal |
| `!=` | not equal |
| `<>` | deprecated in favour of `!=` |
| `>`  | larger than |
| `<`  | smaller than |
| `>=` | larger than or equal |
| `<=` | smaller than or equal |

## Assignment Operators

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `=`  | Assign value from right side to left side | üëå |
| `+=` | Add AND (‚Äúincrement by‚Äù) | `x += 1` does the same as `x = x + 1` |
| `-=` | Subtract AND | `x -= 1` does the same as `x = x - 1` |

## if-statement üîÄ

**Straight line scripts** are what we started off with. But time to get more adventurous!<br>
**Branches** are neat, this means we can make forks in the road and diverge.

`if`, `elif`, `else` will let me write **scripts that decide things**.<br>
_Whoooa! Fork in the road! Wanna go left, right or keep going?!_

## else

This is my safety valve that will keep me out of trouble. Add an `else` on every `if-statement` first, but delete if it turns out to be pointless. Most of the time though, it is justified.

## Hello lists and loops üëã

```python
# Basic list and for-loop example
beers = ['an ipa', 'a stout', 'a porter']

for beer in beers:
    print("I‚Äôll have", beer, "plz.")
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `beers[1]` | The second beer is a stout, because 0 based indexing. |
| `beers[2]` | But if we say the beer _‚Äúat 2‚Äù_ that would be the porter and a [cardinal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number). |
| `beers[1:]` | Slicing away the IPA, and getting the stout and the porter. |
| `beers[-1]` | Negative indexing like this would serve up the last item. |

```python
# How to copy a list
beers = ['an ipa', 'a stout', 'a porter']
morebeers = beers[:]

for secondbeer in morebeers:
    print("I‚Äôll have one more", secondbeer, 'thanks.')
```

* Using `i` as a variable is a convention. (Now I know this. But I still remember how often I got confused by that when I first started reading JavaScript.)
*  `range()` is a [built-in function](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html) (or actually an [immutable sequence type](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#range)).
* `append()` is a method I can use on lists, to add items to it.

## For or while?! ü§î

* for-loops are guaranteed to end, this is called **bounded looping**.
* while-loops are not, and with **unbounded looping** we need to be very sure that a boolean test becomes False at some point or the block of code will keep going forever.

I should use while-loops sparingly. They are easy to grasp, basically an if-statement with a jump back to the beginning. But they are tricky to get right in my scripts.

```python
i = 0
mylist = []

while i < 5:
    i += 1 # an incrementer is often needed in while-loops
    mylist.append(i)

# will make this list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] using a while-loop
```

```python
i = 0
anotherlist = []

for i in range(1,6):
    anotherlist.append(i)

# also make the same list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with a for-loop ü•á
```

When I find myself using a while-loop, I&nbsp;should _probably_ try to figure out how to make it a for-loop. But this is a good expection:

```python
while True:
    # this is one way that I probably do want to use a while-loop
```

## Need some guidelines? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Exercise 36 has some rules and tips for designing and debugging. These can be helpful for me to  revisit when I‚Äôm coding something I can‚Äôt get to work.

* Group `if-elif-else` like a set.
* Avoid nesting if-statements more than two levels.
* Make simple boolean tests. (Do calculations in variables earlier in the function!)

## Debug with printing üêõ

```python
print(">>>> show me something=", something)
```

---

**Misc keywords** that I want to make a note of now:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| assert | ensure that something is true |
| break  | stop this loop |
| del  | delete from dictionary |
| except | do this if an exception happens |
| exec | run a string a Python |
| global | declare a global value |
| lambda | create a short anonymous function |
| pass | this block is empty |
| raise | raise an exeption when things go wrong |
| try | try this! and if exception go to except |

### Remember that‚Ä¶

* **String formats with `%`** are a thing that can be useful to know that exist. This was how to format strings before **f-strings** came along in Python 3.
* [Off-by-one errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error) are something I‚Äôm going to meet a lot.
* Hm‚Ä¶ there is something about function calls I don‚Äôt understand yet. Get back to that soon.
