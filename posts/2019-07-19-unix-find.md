title:  "Find Out More About Find"

First find the manual for `find` 🔎 :

```
man find
```

> The find utility recursively descends the directory tree for each path listed, evaluating an expression (composed of the ``primaries'' and ``operands'' listed below) in terms of each file in the tree.

## 🤨

My co-worker explained it much better to me on Slack:

> `find` is a program that lives in /usr/bin, and you'd usually use it to locate files or folders in your file system that match some filters or requirements.

## Dechiper the cask command 🍺

The homebrew cask fix [command we were dechipering yesterday]({{ '/2019/07/brew-cask/' | url }}) started like this:

```
/usr/bin/find "$(brew --prefix)/Caskroom/"*'/.metadata'
```

I get the same output from that search if it starts with only `find`, but perhaps `/usr/bin/find` is a more fail-safe suggestion? Anyway, I got tripped up by it, because [explainshell.com](https://explainshell.com/) has nothing for `/usr/bin/find` so I started thinking it was “something else”.

The manual is incomprehensible, even the examples are horrible. 😖<br> Thank goodness for helpful co-workers:

> The first argument is usually a folder, that you want to look in

And we checked the different outputs from these three:

```
brew --prefix
echo brew --prefix
echo $(brew --prefix)
```

So now I learnt that putting `$()` around something means the shell will run that _before_ sending the argument to the program. Kinda like in maths! (And I understand what the `--prefix` does, but not what it is or where it comes from. Not mentioned in the brew manual. Hm.)

## Glob patterns 🦃

Say what now? Thankfully Wikipedia describes it nicely:

> glob patterns specify sets of filenames with wildcard characters
> `*` is a wildcard standing for "any string of characters"
> and `*.txt` is a glob pattern –&nbsp;[Glob_(programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming))

Familiar stuff, but phrasing was new(ish). Useful to read about other types of wildcard: `?` for one character and `[xyz]` for one of the characters in the bracket. **And glob is short for global!**  I’ll try to think of that in the future instead of how glob reminds me of gobbling as in turkeys.

Next, checking the different outputs from these:

```
echo *
echo /usr/local/*
echo "$(brew --prefix)/Caskroom/"*'/.metadata'
echo "$(brew --prefix)/Caskroom/"*'/.metadata' | tr " " "\n"
```

That last one echoes back to me what `find` will be given as an argument.

| Some more actions for `find` | 📖 |
| `-type f` | look for files |
| `-type d` | look for directories |
| `-name elisabeth` | look for my name |
| `-name '*.css'` | look for names ending in dot css |
| `-print` | display full pathname on each line |
| `-delete` | delete all the files that matched |
| `-exec` | send output from find as arguments to a program you want to run |



## With and without quotes

> `-name '*.rb'`  (notice the single quotes, they are important!) says that the file name should match the pattern `*.rb`. It has the same rule as the shell globs. But because it's in single quotes, the shell ignores it. So it's up to `find` to make sense of it instead.

The way I understand it, is that the moment you want to search something with a wildcard, you need quotes — otherwise the shell will try to act on the wildcard. Makes sense. (Any quotes? Or is there a difference between single and double?)

### What I was confused about initially

I use a handful of commands that follow the same pattern, you write `git`, `brew`, `cd`, `npm` or whatever first, then something else follows. Something like `/usr/bin/find` and even `man find` break the pattern of starting with the name of the program. So while they’re not really anything brand new to me, I get lost on what the command _is_ and where to learn more about it. Like, it’s not like I can search on the internet for “find”.

### What I understand better now

* I hadn’t entirely grasped what that means for me that Mac OS is Unix-based. Now I will remember that for example searching for `unix find` will point me in the right direction.
* Look! A [list of Unix commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unix_commands) with lots of words I know, but here they are put in relation to each other, which is always helpful for understanding something. 👈👈👈
* [man](`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page`) itself is also a unix command and I need to remember to use it.
