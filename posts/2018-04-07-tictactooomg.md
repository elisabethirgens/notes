The Python game Iâ€™ve been coding! But perhaps more importantly; **my studying is working!**

I started taking stabs [two months ago]({{ '/2018/02/game/' | url }}), with no clue how to approach this, got a bit stuck for a while, did more exercises from [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) â€” including getting through the chapter that introduced [process]({{ '/2018/04/process/' | url }} ). And then, what felt like suddenly and surprisingly, the day after I thoroughly [planned what to code]({{ '/2018/04/game/' | url }}) â€” I was able to sit down and write a program.

Iâ€™ve got the feeling that no one in the history of Python has ever before spent this many commits making tic-tac-toe playable in a terminal. But every one of them are mine. I _really_ wanted to figure this out on my own, without asking anyone for help, and without looking at other peopleâ€™s solutions.

Yesterday, I showed a friend the code I had written, and asked specifically for: _Any tips to point me in the right direction for what to read up, so I can improve in tiny steps while actually learning properly what Iâ€™m doing._ **I had no idea how much this was spot on.** I got the most incredibly awesome review. So now Iâ€™m ridiculously pleased with the plan to first struggle through on my own until I had reached this level, but then to get help now. This will make for excellent learning. ðŸ’ª
