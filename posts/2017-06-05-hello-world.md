Brand new Jekyll blog! ✨ Because I want to try making more purposeful notes. I want to remind `future-me` about what `current-me` is learning, reading, watching, thinking.

### Goal for this format

- quicker to post random short notes than my other writing attempts,
- less volatile than Twitter — and more for me _personally_ than about sharing,
- but still taking advantage of whatever it is that motivates me to publish 8344 tweets, 1037 edited photos on instagram — and a larger number of beers on Untappd than I care to say out loud.

### The rules

- This is an experiment. If I abandon it in 3 weeks or 3 months, that’s perfectly okay.
- No attempts at completing. Do not fall into the trap of trying to record all the things.
- These notes don’t have to be useful for _anyone_ but myself.
