Detour to read Vaidehi Joshi‚Äôs post on [Bits, Bytes, Building With Binary](https://medium.com/basecs/bits-bytes-building-with-binary-13cb4289aafa). I get how computers only know 1s and 0s, also the basics of what binary is. I&nbsp;remember math projects around age 11 where we did a lot of counting and converting. I‚Äôm not 100% sure if I‚Äôm able to convert from base 10 into binary efficiently if my life depended on it today, but I‚Äôm okay with that at the moment.

Just like a [power of 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_10) in the decimal system ‚Äî we‚Äôve got a [power of two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_two) in binary.

> A single digit in binary is known as a binary digit.

8 bits (8 digits) is a byte

> A byte is so common in the way that computers interpret binary that it is considered a unit of computer memory.

(This [basecs series](https://github.com/vaidehijoshi/basecs-series) is amazing, looking foreward to go through the other topics she explains.)

Back to the python exercise:

## Character Encoding

Unicode is not new for me, and I‚Äôve dealt with encoding issues plenty over the years. (Hello Norwegian letters √¶, √∏, √•!) But getting a better understanding of bits was cool.

* first there was ASCII, but 256 characters is not enough past English
* Unicode was created to solve the problem with 32 bits available

> A 32-bit number means we can store 4,294,967,295 characters (2^32), which is enough space for every possible human language and probably a lot of alien ones too. Right now we use the extra space for important things like poop and smile emojis.


* most common characters only need 8 bits
* but we can then escape out into 16 or 32 as needed
* Unicode Transformation Format 8 Bits üëâ `utf-8`
* ‚Ä¶is a convention for encoding Unicode characters into bytes


`b''` is a byte string

Here with raw bytes on the left ‚Äî and cooked on the right ‚Äî this is 8, 16 and 32.<br>
(I don't understand now why 8 is longer than 16 for Simplified Chinese.)

```
b'Espa\xc3\xb1ol' <===> Espa√±ol
b'Norsk bokm\xc3\xa5l' <===> Norsk bokm√•l
b'\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87' <===> ‰∏≠Êñá
```

```
b'\xff\xfeE\x00s\x00p\x00a\x00\xf1\x00o\x00l\x00' <===> Espa√±ol

## ü§ñ&ensp;got bytes, need string? decode!<br>üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è&ensp;got string, need bytes? encode!

This makes sense, sort like encrypting can make a text less readable for me ‚Äî but decrypting makes it something humans can understand.
