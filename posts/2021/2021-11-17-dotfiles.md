title: "Update Dotfile Repo with a .npmrc"

Iâ€™m in the process of setting up my laptop at a new job. Today I came across a preference to install dependencies _without_ the npm default semver range, so I wanted to add [save-exact](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install#save-exact) to my user configuration. This is a fresh setup on a new laptop â€” and I had no `.npmrc` file yet.

```shell
# Set config and also create the .npmrc file if it doesn't exist
npm config set save-exact true
```

```shell
# List directory contents to see my new .npmrc file
ls -la
```

```shell
# Verify that the setting works
npm config get save-exact
```

Cool! That returns `true` and my user npm config will opt to install dependencies with exact versions. But wait-a-minute, missyâ€¦ Donâ€™t you have a dotfile repo to version control files like these? I&nbsp;do indeed. Itâ€™s&nbsp;been a while since I set it up, so needed to remind myself of how to add a new file.

```shell
# Move the file to the repo location
mv .npmrc proj/dotfiles
```

```shell
# Create a symlink from the fileâ€™s new repo location back to home
ln -s ~/proj/dotfiles/.npmrc ~/.npmrc
```

```shell
# List directory contents to check out my new symlink
ls -la
```

Yeah! This now looks different from the previous `ls` I ran on the home directory.<br>
Now I can see `.npmrc ->` pointing to the repo where it actually is located now.

But does the setting still work after I moved the file away from home?

```shell
# Verify the setting works after moving and symlinking
npm config get save-exact
```

Returns `true`. Yay! And now I can commit the `.npmrc` file in my repo and have version control of it along with other dotfiles. ðŸŽ‰
