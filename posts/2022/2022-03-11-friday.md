When MDN documents JavaScript language [expressions and operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators) there are 70 on the list. I find they range from the extremes of _kinda obvious_ — to _lol not gonna need anytime soon_. This post is my study notes of the stuff between what is currently obvious/irrelevant to me. For many of these operators; I&nbsp;know what they do, but I want to learn the correct names and know the categories, what belongs where.

That first link is to the MDN reference docs, but I later found the _guide_ to [expressions and operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) which presents them a bit different and with more explaining of syntax.

- **unary** operators require a single operand, before or after the operator
- **binary** operators require two operands, one before and one after the operator
- and the conditional **ternary** operator is the only JS operator that takes three operands

Some operators are listed under different categories in these two MDN texts, but I guess that just means that the categories are not that clear cut. `!` is a unary operator, but also a logical operator. `++` is unary, but will sometimes be listed under ‘increment and decrement’.

```js
let counter = 0;

// Unary operator with one operand (either before or after)
counter++;

// Binary operator with two operands (one before and one after)
counter > 10;
```

### Assignment operators

> assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand

The simple assignment operator is the humble `=` as in the syntax that assigns a value to a variable, but there’s also a long list of **compound assignment operators** that are shorthand. Three examples:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
||||
|---|---|---|
| Addition assignment | `a += b` | `a = a + b` |
| Subtraction assignment | `a -= b` | `a = a - b` |
| Multiplication assignment | `a *= b` | `a = a * b` |

> The **destructuring assignment** syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

> **Chaining assignments** or nesting assignments in other expressions can result in surprising behavior. For this reason, some JS style guides discourage chaining or nesting assignments

### Comparison operators

Binary operators that take two operands: numbers, strings, logical or object values — and **returns a logical value**. These operators are all pretty clear to me from before. Also; coding in C for [CS50 last year]({{ '/2021/08/cs50/' | url }}) has built a good understanding of types and therefor strict equality. 💃🏻

That said, I think I’ve read the word **logical** in some contexts without it necessarily being clear to me that means we are talking boolean and `true` / `false`. “Comparison operators return a logical value” is a sentence that is useful for me to properly comprehend.

### Arithmetic operators

- Standard arithmetic operations `+` `-` `*` `/`
- Remainder `%` is a binary operator that returns the remainder of dividing it’s two operands
- Increment `++` and decrement `--` can be used postfix or prefix, changing if the value is returned before or after one is added or subtracted from the operand.

I didn’t know that increment/decrement could be used postfix. And while I have used `%` quite a bit, that specific description of it has not made sense to be before now, so that’s cool.

### Bitwise operators

Yeah… I kinda understand these (on some level), but also that this is not where I need to dwell.

### Logical operators

> Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value.

- Logical AND `&&` is used as `expr1 && expr2`
- Logical OR `||` is used as `expr1 || expr2`
- Logical NOT `!` returns `false` if the operand can be converted to `true`

> they are tested for **short-circuit evaluation** using the following rules:

- `false && anything` is short-circuit evaluated to `false`
- `true || anything` is short-circuit evaluated to `true`

### String operators

- `+` is the concatenation operator
- `+=` can also be used to concatenate strings, and is a shorthand assignment operator
