## Create markup from an array

These are two different approaches. Not quite sure which I prefer, but I think perhaps the first because the order of the HTML is logical. The first technique is at first glance a tad more to wrap my head around, but it handles the operation in one swoop quite elegantly once you get used to it, I rekon.

### With Array.map() and Array.join()

```js
const cityList = document.querySelector("#cities");
const array = ["Oslo", "Berlin", "Taipei", "New York", "Bergen"];

// Inject into the DOM the result of setting up <ul>
// then transform the array content with map() to wrap in <li>
// and use array method join() to create a single string
cityList.innerHTML =
  "<ul>" +
  array
    .map(function (city) {
      return "<li>" + city + "</li>";
    })
    .join("") +
  "</ul>";
```

### Or alternatively with a for...of loop

```js
const cityList = document.querySelector("#cities");
const array = ["Oslo", "Berlin", "Taipei", "New York", "Bergen"];
let listItems = "";

// Loop though each item in the array and add to the string
for (const city of array) {
  listItems += "<li>" + city + "</li>";
}
// Finally wrap in <ul> and inject into the DOM
cityList.innerHTML = "<ul>" + listItems + "</ul>";
```

I could write the second in a more verbose way that builds up a string with starting with `<ul>`, then adds the list items before the final closing `</ul>` in that order â€”Â but that became pretty lengthy.
