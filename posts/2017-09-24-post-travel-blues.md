I love travelling. The past 15 years, Iâ€™ve taken trips ranging from 3 days to 3 weeks. Iâ€™ve seen a long list of cities in Europe and the US, and been to some parts of Asia. I am extremely fortunate to be able to do this â€” and donâ€™t want to forget that.

But coming home, I have always been hit with various levels of feeling really down and quite lost. Re-evaluating everything, wondering what I am doing with my life. Happy to return to my bed and my shower â€” but miserable over coming back to everyday life. There was the time I quit my job shortly after a solo trip to Malaysia. But mostly Iâ€™d just daydream and mope until it wore off.

I have always thought it was perpetual wanderlust, that I was doomed to feeling blue coming home after an adventure. I braced myself for this last week, but these feelings never appeared. The trip was fabulous, and I really enjoyed having a proper holiday â€” but it also felt perfectly okay to come back home this time. Perhaps Iâ€™m simply more happy with my everyday life now. Still looking forward to my next trip, but present and connected here at home in the meantime. Basically doing what Iâ€™m supposed to be doing. ðŸ‘Œ
