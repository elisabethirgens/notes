I want to learn more about learning. These are articles I’ve had on my reading list for a while, or partly half skimmed though in an open tab. Now I’m going to actually read them, and write up some notes for me to revisit later.

## [Curse of the Chocolate-Covered Broccoli](https://blog.ncase.me/curse-of-the-chocolate-covered-broccoli-or-emotion-in-learning/) 🥦

Nicky Case has read 4 papers about emotion in learning, so I don’t have to.

* Beginner? I will probably learn best by following step-by-step instructions.
* Advanced? Then learning by exploring will be more effective.

This is interesting, because I feel like my whole career as a developer, people have talked about how it’s best to learn by doing. That seems to make so much sense, but maybe that is only true _after_ you have first created a foundation. Like learning your 3rd or 4th programming language might be most effective by building something, because then you are not a beginner anymore.

Perhaps I would benefit from embrace that my programming skills are still at a beginner level, and my learning will be most effective when it’s guided. I can go off on explorations later. That is probably exactly what happened when I was [learning Python]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018/04/tictactooomg/).

### The loop from cognition to motivation

> You'll learn poorly if you're not motivated, and you'll be demotivated if you're learning poorly. But, from vicious to virtuous cycle: you'll learn well if you're motivated, and you'll be more motivated if you're learning well!

What does this mean for me?

* Cognition: aim for a load that is just above my comfort zone
* Motivation: look for medium sized gaps in what I know

> The original Cognitive Load Theory taught me to strip the chocolate off my broccoli. But finding out that emotion directly improves learning? That taught me I need to season & roast those veggies, to bring out the natural tastiness that's already in the broccoli.

## [Flow is the Opiate of the Mediocre](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2011/12/23/flow-is-the-opiate-of-the-medicore-advice-on-getting-better-from-an-accomplished-piano-player/) 🎹

Cal Newport has written a lot about deliberate practice, I remember having read some of it before. This particular post is with advice from a piano player:

* playing != practicing
* drill the difficult parts (more than the whole)
* know your weaknesses (and work to eliminate them)

## [Learn Like an Athlete](https://www.perell.com/blog/learn-like-an-athlete) 🏀

David Perell makes a strong case for knowledge workers imitating athletes and musicians by training with a learning plan: with a positive vision and broken down to increments.

> The learning project needs to be challenging enough to demand focus, but easy enough to make consistent progress. That way, you can enter the optimal state of learning.

### Note to self

There are steps I could take to make my learning more intentional, with better focus, and not underestimating to also work actively on motivation. Remember to let myself be a beginner, even when everyone else claim it’s best to learn by doing. Take the time to make plans.
