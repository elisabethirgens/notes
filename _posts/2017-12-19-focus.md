I want to 100% understand this properly. Letâ€™s go.

I know thereâ€™s a tabindex attribute, but havenâ€™t used it. Mostly because I am aware that you should be careful with it, and have heard a lot over the years about itâ€™s misuse. And also because I havenâ€™t really  needed or wanted to change the default tab order. The MDN page for [tabindex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex) jumps right in as a reference, and I can tell thereâ€™s something else I need to read up on first.

Yes! Here it is. LÃ©onie Watson has written about [Using the tabindex attribute](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2014/08/using-the-tabindex-attribute/) which explains nicely how keyboard interaction works.

## Interactive HTML elements

Right, these are focusable by default. Which are they again? The most relevant for me to think about right now are:
`<a>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`.

`<input type="hidden">` is not focusable â€” but all the others like `<input type="text">`, `<input type="checkbox">`, `<input type="radio">` and so on.

Oh, and also `<details>` ðŸ’•Â which btw is the coolest HTML element I had never heard about until recently. But with a bright future: [the Details disclosure element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details).

## Tabindex and styling focus

No need for tabindex on elements that are focusable by default. But for elements that are not interactive, setting the attribute with a value `0` will add it to the tab order.

A user can focus on `<div tabindex=0>` and I can style it with the `:focus` pseudo-class. This&nbsp;element will now also inherit focus styles from the user agent stylesheet.

### tabindex negative ðŸ‘Œ

Setting an element to `tabindex=-1` or an other negative integer, makes it programatically focusable, but not included in the tab order. A user canâ€™t reach it, but scripting can.

### tabindex positive ðŸš«

Nope. Donâ€˜t do this. Fix your markup instead.

Thatâ€™s it. Why did I think there was more here I didnâ€™t already know?! ðŸ¤”
