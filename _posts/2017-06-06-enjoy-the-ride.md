## 📺 [Neil Gaiman Commencement Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikAb-NYkseI)

Rewatched this speech today. I don’t want to be a writer, I don’t want to be an artist — but this is 19&nbsp;minutes of general life advice that makes my heart sing. 💕

> …and his advice to me was this: “This is really great. You should enjoy it.” And I didn’t. Best advice I ever got but I ignored. Instead I worried about it. I worried about the next deadline, the next idea, the next story. There wasn’t a moment for the next 14 or 15 years that I wasn’t writing something in my head, or wondering about it. And I didn’t stop and look around and go, this is really fun. I wish I’d enjoyed it more. It’s been an amazing ride. But there were parts of the ride I missed, because I was too worried about things going wrong, about what came next, to enjoy the bit that I was on.
