* [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) used to be the default shell in macOS
* [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) has been many developers’ favourite alternative
* I’ve been happy enough with Bash, but ready to level up 🚀

It’s been 928 days since my notes to figure out [wtf is bash anyway?!]({{ site.baseurl}}/2017/08/wtf-is-bash-anyway/) — and it’s time to move on.

## The internet is helpful 🔗

## Silence the warning 🤫

With macOS Catalina the default shell was changed to Zsh. When I was setting up an new work laptop last November, I was in no way ready to deal with changing all things shell at the same time. But an account set up to use Bash would start getting a persistent and noisy deprecation warning:

```
The default interactive shell is now zsh.
To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.
```

At the time, I put this in my `.bash_profile` to make the warning go away:

```
export BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1
```

But today is the day we level up and change the shell. Soooo, how tf to do that?! 🤷🏻‍♀️

## Configure account to now use zsh

Before I removed the silencing and got back the helpful deprecation warning… I was reading about how to change it in the GUI under System Preferences. There’s a hidden “advanced options” you can find with a control-click on user name. The [article from Apple](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050) also attempts to describe how to do it from the command line, so I was doing a `cat /etc/shells` to understand what they meant with “one of the shell paths listed”. But anyway, the deprecation warning explained exactly what to run:

`chsh -s /bin/zsh`

## But how to migrate existing bash stuff?! 🤔

> .zprofile is equivalent to .bash_profile and runs at login, including over SSH <br>
> .zshrc is equivalent to .bashrc and runs for each new Terminal session

Ok!? Not sure this was the way to go, but I renamed these files like so:

```
mv .bashrc .zshrc
mv .bash_profile .zprofile
```

New shell is now spewing out these warnings:

```
/Users/x/.zshrc:6: command not found: shopt
WARNING: this script is deprecated, please see git-completion.zsh
\[\e[1;35m\]\u@\h\[\e[0m\] \[\e[1;34m\]\w\[\e[1;31m\]$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\] $
```

Ha. I know what those 3 things are. And happy with past-me for writing comments:

```
shopt -s histappend
```

```
# add reference to git completion from xcode command line tools
[ -f /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/share/git-core/git-completion.bash ] && . /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/share/git-core/git-completion.bash
```

```
# make a useful promt with pretty colours
parse_git_branch() {
    git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}
export PS1="\[\e[1;35m\]\u@\h\[\e[0m\] \[\e[1;34m\]\w\[\e[1;31m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\] $ "
```

Hm. I’ll remove them and figure out how to set up something similar in zsh. All right, then the noise is gone. Let’s see what works and what doesn’t?!

## Aliases still work…

That’s unexpected. Ah, I have this in my now named `.zshrc` and that apparently finds them:

```
# add reference to bash aliases
if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
    . ~/.bash_aliases
fi
```

For now, I am deleting my `.bash_aliases` file completely, and copying the aliases I want to keep over to `.zshrc`. Also deleting `.bash_history` while I’m at it, though I have kept a copy as a txt file in case something useful resides in there.

## A POSIX-compliant profile ?!

> If you're using .profile, you can make zsh automatically read its settings by adding this command to .zprofile:

```
[[ -e ~/.profile ]] && emulate sh -c 'source ~/.profile'
```

Ok. Yes. I’ve got that file. But the only thing it contains is:

```
# set bin directory for cargo (package manager for Rust)
# in my PATH environment variable (auto by the rustup installer)
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

Not sure what to do about this. Checking the [docs on Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) I see there’s mention about **Configuring the PATH environment variable**. Perhaps I can run some `rustup` install scripts to confgure the path correctly. Or I can just see if something breaks next week when developing.

## Zsh todo

Making a list of what I’ve lost and/or intentionally removed:

* promt
* git completion
* something with nvm bash_completion
* how history works (there’s a new `.zsh_history` but it’s empty

There are also tokens and paths I want to check still works. I was a bit curious about setting up minimal configuration before going bananas with frameworks and plugins. Read about manually [Adding Git Completion to Zsh](https://medium.com/@oliverspryn/adding-git-completion-to-zsh-60f3b0e7ffbc) but decided to proceed with choosing between:

## Oh My Zsh or Prezto?

> Oh-my-zsh has a much larger selection of themes and plugins, but Prezto’s tab completion is noticeably faster. If you have a plugin you’d really miss by switching to Prezto, I’d suggest sticking with oh-my-zsh. Otherwise, the speed increase is well worth the switch.

While [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) is obviously widely used and maintained, I’m going to go with the community and what I’d heard about before, and install [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).

```
         __                                     __
  ____  / /_     ____ ___  __  __   ____  _____/ /_
 / __ \/ __ \   / __ `__ \/ / / /  /_  / / ___/ __ \
/ /_/ / / / /  / / / / / / /_/ /    / /_(__  ) / / /
\____/_/ /_/  /_/ /_/ /_/\__, /    /___/____/_/ /_/
                        /____/                       ....is now installed!
```

Right, I now have files attempting to zsh config, so perhaps diving straight for the framework would have made more sense then renaming like I did. But anyway!

## 🥳

And now for plugins and themes bonanza…
