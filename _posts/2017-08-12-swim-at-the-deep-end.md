**Something has changed.** I got the sense a couple of times earlier this summer. And when I this week [upgraded Yarn]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017/08/yarn-upgrade-adventures/) ‚Äî it became impossible to not notice that something has changed.

It feels like I am swimming at the deep end, when I didn‚Äôt know that I could.

## I didn‚Äôt know before now‚Ä¶ üôÉ

* what I am capable of figuring out on my own.
* the extent of what I can learn within a couple of hours.
* how I can dig into something unknown and end up *getting* it.
* that I could branch out and absorb new knowledge at this level.
* how all that previously incomprehensible documentation is actually well within what I am able to read, understand and use to solve hard problems.

But now I do. And it has been a serious boost. I will not limit myself to only attempt solving problems in the vicinity of what I already know. I will no longer accept copy/pasting commands that I don‚Äôt understand. And I will make it a priority to be less impatient with what I try to learn.

## So‚Ä¶ why did this change for me? ü§î

* I have been thinking about [how to learn more on purpose]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017/06/learning/
).
* My team has recently had a lot of discussions around when people should ask for help, and when to invest time in figuring out problems on your own.
* It had been explicitly repeated that it‚Äôs okay to use work hours to learn.
* Circumstances meant it felt perfectly fine to set aside what I originally planned to work on that day. No&nbsp;one was waiting for any specific delivery from me.
* I reflected upfront over how this was probably going to be really uncomfortable, and made a conscious decision to practice being okay with having that feeling. ‚úåÔ∏è

Now I know that I can swim at the deep end ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next.
