> The Sad, Beautiful Fact That We're All Going To Miss Almost Everything

[This article](http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2011/04/21/135508305/the-sad-beautiful-fact-that-were-all-going-to-miss-almost-everything) is about culture. I read it after watching [Simon Collison talk at Creative Mornings](https://vimeo.com/53113556), where he transferred the idea to which topics to learn as a designer. I can still remember the feeling I got from being introduced to “cull and surrender” back then, four years ago now.

I think about this a lot. Well… I try to.

> **Culling** is the choosing you do for yourself. **Surrender** is the realization that you do not have time for everything that would be worth the time you invested in it.

Linda Holmes writes about these two as a balance. How we should accept there is so much that could be worth our time — it’s not just about dividing all the things into interesting or not.

* books, music, films, television and art
* activities and travel destinations
* potential tasks at work
* stuff to learn
* people

I will miss almost everything. And that is fine.
