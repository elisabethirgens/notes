This month I have left logistics behind for a new job in the financial sector. This is a domain that I know absolutely nothing about, so there are plenty of words to learn. I will start with these:

## Oslo Stock Exchange üèõ

There are different marketplaces with separate sets of requirements.

| Oslo B√∏rs | A full stock exchange listing for large companies with a track record |
| Oslo Axess | A regulated market for companies with less than 3 years history |
| Merkur Market | Multilateral trading facility with less strict requirements and reporting |

##  Instruments üéª

Common naming in the codebase! Because it‚Äôs a collective term for misc tradables.

> Financial instruments are monetary contracts between parties. They can be created, traded, modified and settled. [‚Äì Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_instrument)

- Equities ‚Äì shares and [stocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock) (not technically exactly the same, but more or less)
- Derivatives ‚Äì a contract that derives its value from something else
- Bonds ‚Äì a bind to pay a loan (‚Äúobligasjon‚Äù in Norwegian)

This is way more complex, but learning the difference roughly for a handful will do for now.
