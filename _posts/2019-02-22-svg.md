> Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML. <br>
– 🍒 [Pocket Guide to Writing SVG](http://svgpocketguide.com/) by Joni Trythall

🦕 [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) is another resource to keep in an open tab these next weeks.

I’ve worked with vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator for 15 years, and a couple of years with SVG (that doesn’t move). I’ve got a decent enough grasp of the vector graphics part with points on a&nbsp;coordinate system. But…

### What does it actually mean that SVG is XML…?

| HTML | XML |
| --- | --- |
| Hypertext Markup Language | Extensible Markup Language |
| describes presentation | describes content |
| used to display data | used to transport data |
| all tags are predefined | has no predefined tags |
| you can’t define any custom tags | you have to define custom tags |

Nice! Here’s how I now understand the part about XML not having predefined tags:

It doesn’t mean I can write SVG containing with any random element I define, the browser wouldn’t understand my `<cocktail-glass-shape>`. But the W3C SVG Working Group could leverage the language XML to define a `<cocktail-glass-shape>`. In the case of SVG, this part of XML is not that relevant for me as an `<svg>` coder. The XML language feature to define my own tags becomes way more interesting in _other_ settings.
