I’m getting to the point at work where it’s about time to *understand* more web technology. How do these web apps we’re building actually work — beyond the markup, styles and scripts I’m used to thinking about? Some notes from reading [MDN web docs about HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview):

* A protocol for communication between browsers and servers,
* …on the application layer (that’s the last one, closest to the end user),
* …which is similar to DNS, FTP, IMAP, POP, SMTP, SSH, TLS/SSL.

## Requests and responses

💻 A browser initiates a *request* to fetch resources.<br>
🌎 The server provides a *response* to deliver the answer.

## User-agent and proxy
> The user-agent is any tool that acts on the behalf of the user.

Between the user’s computer and the web server, there are proxies acting as gateways and handle operations like: caching, filtering, load balancing, authentication, logging.

## HTTP messages
Examples of some elements they can contain are:

### Methods
* `GET` is a method to fetch a resource
* `POST` is a method to send data to the server

### Headers
Information sent as `"Name: Value"` pairs to describe a resource. This all looks very familiar, but I haven’t understood before now how HTTP headers fit into the world around them.

### Status code and message
Oh hey! 👋 I know you. But some more details and more examples:

* 1xx are information responses 💁
* 2xx means there was a successful respons ⭐️
* 3xx are used for redirection messages ♻️
* 4xx when there’s a problem with the request from the client 😕
* 5xx if there’s an error with the server 😱


* `200 OK`&emsp;Success, for example that the resource is fetched and in the message body.
* `401 Unauthorized`&emsp;…or really “unauthenticated”. Not sure you are who you say you are!
* `403 Forbidden`&emsp;Yeah yeah, we know who you are, but you can’t access this.
* `500 Internal Server Error`&emsp;Halp. I don’t know how to handle this.

## Cache, cookies and CORS

There’s **private browser cache** on my laptop, and what’s called **shared proxy cache** somewhere else down the pipeline. There’s a `Cache-Control` header field that can specify different mechanisms, and now I see how one name can be repeated in headers to set multiple values.

I know what cookies are! But not that they technically belong here, so that’s interesting to grasp. Also noting that the recommended modern approach is to use [Web storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) for client storage. I’m also vaguely familiar with what [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) is, but again — it’s super cool to now be able to put it into this HTTP box for a more complete picture.

## Network Monitor

I’ll make an effort to keep this open more often, and actively pay attention to what’s happening with the resources on pages I’m working on.
