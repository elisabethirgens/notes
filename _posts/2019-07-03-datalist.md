`<datalist>` looks like a nifty HTML5 element, but I’ve hardly heard about it and can’t remember seeing it used much, neither as a coder or as a citizen of the internet. Why is that?

```html
<label for="trip">Select a city to visit:</label>
<input list="city-suggestions" id="trip" name="trip" />
<datalist id="city-suggestions">
    <option value="Taipei">
    <option value="Tokyo">
    <option value="Trondheim">
</datalist>
```

Yay! Browser native autocomplete functionality from list of suggested cities. But I can also type something else that is not presented as an option. Compared to a classic `<select>` the full list of options are hidden from me, so it’s only a useful pattern if I already know the options. If the list is super long, it can even be extra helpful to not be presented with the entire list of options.

For me as a user, choosing a country would be easier with a `<datalist>`.

But… as a developer, that means you need to handle typos and pranks and geopolitical disputes. Not&nbsp;great for logistics systems or anything that requires exact data as input. There are probably interesting use cases that have a higher tolerance though, when grouping some outliers as “miscellaneous countries” are perfectly acceptable. Perhaps if exceptions can be handled manually. Or in a survey, where making a form easy to complete is a priority over accuracy.

Browser support? There’s a lot of light green on [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#feat=datalist) for partial support, but looks like the bugs are pretty specific cases, so worth looking into their relevance. There’s also a [vanilla JS polyfill](https://github.com/mfranzke/datalist-polyfill) that can help. Always fond of the concept of polyfills that can be removed in the future.

Other controls? 🤔 So not only for text inputs, but also things like range or select. Whoa! Jeremy Keith wrote [The design of datalist](https://adactio.com/journal/4272/) way back in 2011 that mentions the technique of using the same option elements for the select and the datalist.

Definitely want to dig into this some more another day. 💙 HTML 💙
