As part of my mission to [Get Unstuck]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018/03/get-unstuck/), I’ve now realized that if I’m not sufficiently inspired to tackle moving forward — backtracking can be great. Moving beats standing still! But I’ve been too impatient to discover how useful it can be to revisit previous chapters in [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/). During exercises 27–39, the content felt pretty familiar. I’ve seen lists and loops and `if`s before, none of it was brand new magic. But maaaybe I breezed through this part of the book too fast. Let’s revisit!

## The Truth Terms

>  Logic on a computer is all about seeing if some combination of these characters and some variables is True at that point in the program.

`and`&emsp;`or`&emsp;`not`&emsp;`!=`&emsp;`==`&emsp;`>=`&emsp;`<=`&emsp;`True`&emsp;`False`

* Exercise 27 is about memorizing truth tables.
* Exercise 28 is practicing more complex Boolean logic.
* _“Burn Boolean logic into your brain”_ 😜

Note to self: those two ☝️ are worth revisiting when I need easy-going backtrack studying.

## Arithmetic Operators

These are the basic ones `+` `-` `*` `/`, along with more complex ones like Modulus&nbsp;`%` and Exponent&nbsp;`**` that I really don’t see myself needing any time soon, but this one is worth noting:

| `//` | Floor Division | `9//2 = 4` |

## Comparison Operators

| `==` | equal |
| `!=` | not equal |
| `<>` | deprecated in favour of `!=` |
| `>`  | larger than |
| `<`  | smaller than |
| `>=` | larger than or equal |
| `<=` | smaller than or equal |

## Assignment Operators

| `=`  | Assign value from right side to left side | 👌 |
| `+=` | Add AND (“increment by”) | `x += 1` does the same as `x = x + 1` |
| `-=` | Subtract AND | `x -= 1` does the same as `x = x - 1` |

## if-statement 🔀

**Straight line scripts** are what we started off with. But time to get more adventurous!<br>
**Branches** are neat, this means we can make forks in the road and diverge.

`if`, `elif`, `else` will let me write **scripts that decide things**.<br>
_Whoooa! Fork in the road! Wanna go left, right or keep going?!_

## else

This is my safety valve that will keep me out of trouble. Add an `else` on every `if-statement` first, but delete if it turns out to be pointless. Most of the time though, it is justified.

## Hello lists and loops 👋

```python
# Basic list and for-loop example
beers = ['an ipa', 'a stout', 'a porter']

for beer in beers:
    print("I’ll have", beer, "plz.")
```

| `beers[1]` | The second beer is a stout, because 0 based indexing. |
| `beers[2]` | But if we say the beer _“at 2”_ that would be the porter and a [cardinal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number). |
| `beers[1:]` | Slicing away the IPA, and getting the stout and the porter. |
| `beers[-1]` | Negative indexing like this would serve up the last item. |

```python
# How to copy a list
beers = ['an ipa', 'a stout', 'a porter']
morebeers = beers[:]

for secondbeer in morebeers:
    print("I’ll have one more", secondbeer, 'thanks.')
```

* Using `i` as a variable is a convention. (Now I know this. But I still remember how often I got confused by that when I first started reading JavaScript.)
*  `range()` is a [built-in function](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html) (or actually an [immutable sequence type](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#range)).
* `append()` is a method I can use on lists, to add items to it.

## For or while?! 🤔

* for-loops are guaranteed to end, this is called **bounded looping**.
* while-loops are not, and with **unbounded looping** we need to be very sure that a boolean test becomes False at some point or the block of code will keep going forever.

I should use while-loops sparingly. They are easy to grasp, basically an if-statement with a jump back to the beginning. But they are tricky to get right in my scripts.

```python
i = 0
mylist = []

while i < 5:
    i += 1 # an incrementer is often needed in while-loops
    mylist.append(i)

# will make this list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] using a while-loop
```

```python
i = 0
anotherlist = []

for i in range(1,6):
    anotherlist.append(i)

# also make the same list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with a for-loop 🥇
```

When I find myself using a while-loop, I&nbsp;should _probably_ try to figure out how to make it a for-loop. But this is a good expection:

```python
while True:
    # this is one way that I probably do want to use a while-loop
```

## Need some guidelines? 🤷‍♀️

Exercise 36 has some rules and tips for designing and debugging. These can be helpful for me to  revisit when I’m coding something I can’t get to work.

* Group `if-elif-else` like a set.
* Avoid nesting if-statements more than two levels.
* Make simple boolean tests. (Do calculations in variables earlier in the function!)

## Debug with printing 🐛

```python
print(">>>> show me something=", something)
```

---

**Misc keywords** that I want to make a note of now:

| assert | ensure that something is true |
| break  | stop this loop |
| del  | delete from dictionary |
| except | do this if an exception happens |
| exec | run a string a Python |
| global | declare a global value |
| lambda | create a short anonymous function |
| pass | this block is empty |
| raise | raise an exeption when things go wrong |
| try | try this! and if exception go to except |

### Remember that…

* **String formats with `%`** are a thing that can be useful to know that exist. This was how to format strings before **f-strings** came along in Python 3.
* [Off-by-one errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error) are something I’m going to meet a lot.
* Hm… there is something about function calls I don’t understand yet. Get back to that soon.
